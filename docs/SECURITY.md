## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report minor vulnerabilities by [creating an issue](../../../issues/new/choose), or if you're able to remedy the issue, [creating a pull request](../../compare). For major vulnerabilities please contact [gamercoder215@teaminceptus.us](mailto:gamercoder215@teaminceptus.us).
